The /home/agent/work folder syncs with the host system, so you need to
do all your work in that folder so that it persists when the VM is stopped.

There is an example AGENTS.md file in the work folder with some ideas in it.

Install programming languages or tools with mise.
Refer to /home/agent/MISE_README.md for more details.
