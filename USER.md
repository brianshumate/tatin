## Context

Brian is building Tatin — a project that secures LLM agents inside Tart virtual machines. Sandboxing agents properly, not trusting them to behave on their own. The right approach.

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
