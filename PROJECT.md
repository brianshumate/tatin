# Tatin

Tatin is a VM sandbox for large running potentially dangerous language model agent workflows on Apple Silicon Macs.

Tatin uses these fine technologies to accomplish its goals:

- Packer
- Tart
- Vagrant
- Vagrant Tart plugin
- Debian Linux
- A range of languages and agent tools
  - Claude Code
  - Crush
  - OpenCode
  - Vault 

The aim of Tatin is a safe place for agents to run without permissions required to maximize efficiency and throughput.
